## My process

First I decided to write the HTML and CSS code for 'rating state' of the website. I worked with mobile first approach and try to make sure it scales nicely onto the Desktop device. 

Second part was adding active and hover states to the buttons. I then researched how to make a previously selected button uncheck and check a new user selection.

Next, I coded 'thank you state'. Once I was happy with how it looked I made sure. The buttons in 'rating state' do correct actions to display 'thank you state'. I then included users choice to display in final screen.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- Vanilla Javascript

### What I learned

In this little project I learned valuable information about click event, and looping through an array of objects. 

I also got to test my theoretical knowledge thus far of basic javascript syntax and methods.


If you want more help with writing markdown, we'd recommend checking out [The Markdown Guide](https://www.markdownguide.org/) to learn more.


### Continued development

In the next project I will focus on using SCSS and functions in my javascript code.

### Useful resources
